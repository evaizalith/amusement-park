      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">I don't know HOW this got here, I don't know WHAT it does, and I don't know WHY it exists. We literally were making the park one day and then: bam! This thing shows up out of nowhere with some random guy in the booth. Even though it's run down, people can still (barely) ride it. Additionally, the man in the control booth is both irritable and unhelpful, often getting upset at people when they ask to ride, and frequently sending people on an accidental second lap of the ride. We can't even ask him to leave since the booth he is in is seemingly indestructible and he just shuts the door whenever somebody tries to talk to him. Only reason why he's still here is because the higher ups think we can market this as some "crazy mystery!" but honestly, this ride is doing more harm than good.</h5>
